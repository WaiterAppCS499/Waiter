{"name":"Waiter","tagline":"Restaurant Wait Times","body":"### Go. Eat. Enjoy. Repeat.\r\nInstead of calling restaurants in your area for wait times, enter your parties' information and get results instantly. Narrow down your options quickly and make eating out less of a hassle. Most importantly: Don't keep your friends waiting.\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\nWhen users (that's you!) author a wait time post, its pushed to our database. From there other users can look up those wait times depending on their parties' information to decide which option is best for them. \r\n\r\n### Creator + Developer\r\nMy name is Noemi Zamarripa (@gnomiethelovely) and I'm a graduating senior at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. Waiter was inspired by the struggles of my friend's and I trying to get a table for 6, its harder than it sounds. Hopefully, this makes it a little easier.\r\n\r\n### You can count on us\r\nHaving trouble? No worries. Send us an email at: waiterappdev@gmail.com. We're here for you.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
